# Introductory tutorials with simple components

These tutorials provide basic examples with the intention to learn the basic modeling ideas implemented in REMix and how to build simple components.
The software provides a lot of modeling flexibility to the user, therefore we outline different aspects of the used components in each of the following sections:

- {ref}`Simple energy conversion plant model <simple_energy_conversion_intro>` in linear modeling,
- {ref}`Tracking CO<sub>2</sub> emissions <simple_indicator_intro>` using the so called "indicators",
- {ref}`Modeling infeed from renewable energy sources <vre_intro>` at the example of a wind farm,
- {ref}`Introducing slack <slack_variables_label>` used to prevent model infeasibilities and
- {ref}`Mixed integer programming <explanations_mip_label>` for energy conversion plants.
