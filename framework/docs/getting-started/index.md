# Getting Started

In this chapter we provide:

- {ref}`Installation information for REMix <installation_label>`
- {ref}`Hands on examples to learn using REMix <remix_introductory_tutorial>`
- {ref}`A tutorial to build an Energy System step by step <tutorials_introduction_label>`
- Information on a previous large project: {ref}`FlexMex <example_projects_label>`

```{note}
Especially the hands on examples showcase very simple applications.
The {ref}`strengths of REMix <remix_key_features>` especially lie in larger scale models.
Therefore, the introductory sections is more focused on teaching how the elements of the software can be used.
