The Aniwhenua scheme consists of a 200 meter long, 10 meter high dam structure with two radial control gates which can discharge 1,270 cubic meters of water per second. Three additional flap gates are designed to handle higher flood conditions. A 2.2 kilometer canal with a fall rate of 1 in 2,500 diverts water from the lake to a head pond above the powerhouse. Water flows from the head of the pond through steeply dropping penstocks at a rate of 75 cubic meters a second to the powerhouse.

The Arapuni power station was the first government-built hydroelectric station on the Waikato River. During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. 
Construction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added.

New Zealand biomass fuel is considered a renewable energy because it can be replenished by new plantations. The fuel is burnt in a boiler to produce steam for a 28MW steam turbine and for the pulp and paper mill (contradicting info: Allen 39.6 Mwe Type H-6, pass-out back pressure steam turbine (STG) driving a Peebles generator through an Allen Gears parallel shaft speed reduction gearbox.

The scheme was designed to meet the generating needs of some 235 consumers. The Kourarau Power Scheme does not feed directly into the national grid. The electricity is distributed throughout the Wairarapa area. Each station is fed by a small artificial reservoir formed by the damming of Kourarau Stream. Between each reservoir and the associated power station are sections of pipeline and penstocks that take water from the reservoir to a power station. Water from the Lower Power Station is discharged back into the natural channel of the Kourarau Stream. The Upper Dam and Reservoir were formed in 1925 by the damming of Kourarau Stream with an earth dam. The reservoir covers approximately 15 hectares. Water from the upper reservoir is taken through the Upper Power Station at a maximum rate of 290 litres per second. The upper reservoir has a normal operating range of 650 mm between minimum level and the spillway crest. During floods water that cannot be taken into the power station flows over the spillway and into the natural channel of Kourarau Stream. The Upper Power Station is a 200 KW (actual generator rating 250KW) station that uses a maximum flow of 290 litres per second to generate electricity. Water enters the Upper Power Station from the Upper Reservoir via a 785 metre long pipeline and single penstock system. A surge chamber is situated between the penstock and the pipeline to relieve pressure from the system that builds up due to fluctuating flows and generation patterns. The Lower Reservoir is 1.4 hectares in area and located downstream of the confluence of the Kourarau Stream and Sailormans Creek. The reservoir is formed by an earth dam, approximately 4 metres in height. Water enters the lake from the Upper Power Station tailrace and from the Kourarau Stream, including the flow from Sailormans Creek. The upper level of the lake is controlled by a fixed weir concrete-lined spillway. During floods, any water that cannot pass through the Lower Power Station, via the intake, flows over the spillway down the natural channel of Kourarau Stream. From the Lower Reservoir, water passes through a single 1182-metre pipeline to a surge tower. The pipeline then splits into two penstocks that carry water a further 2136 metres to the Lower Power Station. Water enters the two penstocks at a maximum rate of 900 litres per second. The Lower Power Station is a 900 KW station (actual generator rating 700 KW) situated adjacent to Kourarau Stream.

The other part was built on the Canterbury (north) side of the river, with 11 sluice gates enabling water to flow through while the second section was being built on the Otago side. The station’s powerhouse was completed in 1934 after the dam was built. It was made of reinforced concrete and was 109 metres long. It was extended to 152 metres in the early 1950s to house the last set of new generators. The station’s first two generators were commissioned in 1935, and a third generator in 1940. Two more generators were installed in 1941 and 1949, bringing the station to its capacity of 75 MW. In 1952 the Pukaki and Tekapo water storage projects were finished, and the power station took advantage of the improved water flow. The station’s sixth and seventh generators – each 15 MW – were installed in 1954, and the station increased its capacity to the present-day level of 105 MW.
