We recycle the sulphur to make sulphuric acid. This is then reacted with the phosphate rock to solubilise the phosphate, making superphosphate fertiliser. The production of sulphuric acid also generates heat, which we capture and convert to electricity. We create enough electricity to power our site and the excess (which is enough to power around 3000 homes in our community) is fed back into the National Grid.

During the initial surveying in 1916, an old watercourse was found just upstream of one of the narrowest parts of the gorge. In 1920, the surveying was halted due to lack of government funds to progress the project. 
Construction finally began in 1924, but repeated heavy rain and the resulting floods dogged the early works. Just after the project was commissioned in mid-1929, the station was closed for two years while a water seepage problem was investigated and the headrace lined. The station began operating again in May 1932 with four generators installed. Four more machines have since been added.

The river carries considerable pumice debris and the original lake was fully silted in it's first 25 years of existence. 
Levees have been built to form future silt ponds for the time when dredging of the lake area above the weir will become necessary to maintain storage. The HA lake is a wildlife sanctuary and has become the habitat of a wide variety of wild fowl. The lake in the past has been stocked with salvelinus fontinalis brook trout by the Wildlife Conservancy. The HA dam is comprised of an arch dam 12m deep in a narrow ignimbright gorge with an adjacent 90m long weir perched on the surface of the ignimbright rock with the intake structure situated on the left bank at the end of the weir. 
A remote controlled and hydraulically operated bypass gate has been placed in the dam which is capable of passing 5 cumecs when required. 
The intake chamber contains hydraulically operated bypass gates, intake screens and screen scraper mechanism. The screen scrapers cope with pumice debris and lake weed and the scraper operation is initiated by both pressure differential across the screen and time switch control. 
Two 243 metre long penstocks, one 1.67m in diameter and one 1.8m in diameter, lead from the intake chamber to the power station. The power station contains two horizontal shaft machines with Francis turbines",EA exisiting generating plants (2015),-38.8907,176.0923,WTO,

The scheme was designed to meet the generating needs of some 235 consumers. The Kourarau Power Scheme does not feed directly into the national grid. The electricity is distributed throughout the Wairarapa area. Each station is fed by a small artificial reservoir formed by the damming of Kourarau Stream. Between each reservoir and the associated power station are sections of pipeline and penstocks that take water from the reservoir to a power station. Water from the Lower Power Station is discharged back into the natural channel of the Kourarau Stream. The Upper Dam and Reservoir were formed in 1925 by the damming of Kourarau Stream with an earth dam. The reservoir covers approximately 15 hectares. Water from the upper reservoir is taken through the Upper Power Station at a maximum rate of 290 litres per second. The upper reservoir has a normal operating range of 650 mm between minimum level and the spillway crest. During floods water that cannot be taken into the power station flows over the spillway and into the natural channel of Kourarau Stream. The Upper Power Station is a 200 KW (actual generator rating 250KW) station that uses a maximum flow of 290 litres per second to generate electricity. Water enters the Upper Power Station from the Upper Reservoir via a 785 metre long pipeline and single penstock system. A surge chamber is situated between the penstock and the pipeline to relieve pressure from the system that builds up due to fluctuating flows and generation patterns. The Lower Reservoir is 1.4 hectares in area and located downstream of the confluence of the Kourarau Stream and Sailormans Creek. The reservoir is formed by an earth dam, approximately 4 metres in height. Water enters the lake from the Upper Power Station tailrace and from the Kourarau Stream, including the flow from Sailormans Creek. The upper level of the lake is controlled by a fixed weir concrete-lined spillway. During floods, any water that cannot pass through the Lower Power Station, via the intake, flows over the spillway down the natural channel of Kourarau Stream. From the Lower Reservoir, water passes through a single 1182-metre pipeline to a surge tower. The pipeline then splits into two penstocks that carry water a further 2136 metres to the Lower Power Station. Water enters the two penstocks at a maximum rate of 900 litres per second. The Lower Power Station is a 900 KW station (actual generator rating 700 KW) situated adjacent to Kourarau Stream.

This plant is located at the Carter Holt Harvey Pulp and Paper Plant at Kinleith, Tokoroa. It is fuelled by wood waste biomass supplemented as necessary with gas. The waste wood is a combination of bark, sawdust and chips, mainly pine with some eucalyptus. New Zealand biomass fuel is considered a renewable energy because it can be replenished by new plantations. The fuel is burnt in a boiler to produce steam for a 28MW steam turbine and for the pulp and paper mill. The bulk of the electricity generated is used on site. Carter Holt Harvey and Genesis Energy work closely to ensure a reliable steam supply for this major wood-processing site. The plant is owned by Genesis Energy, and Carter Holt Harvey operate and maintain the plant under contract to Genesis Energy. Engineering support for the plant is provided by the Genesis Energy engineering team based at Huntly Power Station. Total capacity is 28MW about 11% is from natural gas (about 3 MW) the rest is generated from Wood (about 25MW).",MBIE thermal stack update (2020); EA exisiting generating plants (2015),-38.226,175.8663,WTO,
